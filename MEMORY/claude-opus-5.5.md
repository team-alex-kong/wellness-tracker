## Chronological Activity Log

### 2026-09-29 — 30-day release cooldown
- `[tool.uv] exclude-newer = "30 days"` + `required-version >=0.9.17`; relocked with uv 0.9.17 (system uv 0.8.17 silently ignores it and relocks newer).

### 2026-09-29 — branch rename
- PR #1 closed by user; branch renamed to `feat/home-screen-app-and-repo-cleanup`.
- Stale remote branches `chore/agents-md-setup-and-uv`, `claude/nice-wright-ctgbqn` need manual deletion (proxy 403).

### 2026-09-29 — Samsung Internet home-screen web app
- Added manifest.webmanifest, sw.js (+ `/sw.js` route), apple-touch-icon; Chromium reports no installability errors.
- Pushed to PR #1 per user. User wants the branch renamed; needs GitHub UI rename (session proxy blocks remote branch ops).

### 2026-09-29 — flake8 cleanup
- Removed unused imports and `global app` in http_service.py; flake8 clean on src/.

### 2026-09-29 — uv migration
- Branch renamed `claude/nice-wright-ctgbqn` → `chore/agents-md-setup-and-uv`; old remote branch not deleted yet.
- Replaced requirements.txt with pyproject.toml + uv.lock; README uses `uv sync` / `uv run`; declared `numpy`.
- PR: alex-lt-kong-clone/wellness-tracker#1. Old remote branch deletion blocked (proxy 403); user to delete manually.

### 2026-09-29 — AGENTS.md repo update
- Ignored `tmp/`, added PREFERENCE.md, trimmed long comments in src/*.py (net −30 LOC).
- Pre-existing flake8 warnings (unused imports, F824 in http_service.py) left untouched.

### 2026-09-29 — session startup
- Read AGENTS.md; created this memory file (none existed). PREFERENCE.md does not exist yet.
